# CFTK

CFTK is a cfDNA multimodal epigenetic analysis toolkit for processing
cfMethyl-Seq style data and running downstream methylation, fragmentomics,
visualization, modeling, and report workflows.

The package is under active development. The current command-line entry point is
implemented in `src/cftk.py` and is driven by a project configuration file named
`cftk_init.json`.

## Documentation

The documentation website is built with Sphinx and the PyData Sphinx Theme.

Build it locally with:

```bash
python -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
python -m sphinx -b html docs docs/_build/html
```

Then open:

```text
docs/_build/html/index.html
```

## Quick Start

Validate the example configuration:

```bash
python src/cftk.py --config cftk_init.json init
```

Inspect available commands:

```bash
python src/cftk.py --help
```

Run a raw processing step after editing `cftk_init.json` for your samples,
reference files, tools, and output directory:

```bash
python src/cftk.py --config cftk_init.json process -s 1 2 3 4
```

Some workflows require external bioinformatics tools and reference files that
are not installed by Python packaging alone. See the documentation for details.
